# Image-Classfication-Tasks

The goal for this repo is to keep a record of COMP_SCI 499 Project for each week and save useful materials online.


### **Week 1**
- **Learning Objectives:** Basic image classification tasks with simple models using **Pytorch** and **Jax**
- **Learning Outcomes:** Finish using Pytorch and Jax to build a Lenet-5 model to do image classification tasks.

- **Findings & Conclusion:**

| Framework/Diff     | Model Bulding     | 第二列     |
| ---------- | :-----------:  | :-----------: |
| Pytorch    | - model is a class <br> - Define each layer as variables and go through each layer in the foward function    | 第二列     |
| Jax    | 第一列     | 第二列     |
